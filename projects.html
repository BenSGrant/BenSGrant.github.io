				<a href="https://github.com/bensgrant/bg-budgeter">BG-Budgeter</a><br>
				<br>Start: April 27th 2024
				<br><br>
				This project aims to create a bespoke, simple and easy to use budgeting app. The inspiration behind this <br>
				project was for me, the developer, to improve my programming skills and also to create a tool which I could use in <br> 
				the future (specifically for when I'm studying at university).
				<br>
				<br>
				This project utilises Python and PyQt5 to create the GUI. I use Visual Studio Code and Qt Designer to help develop<br>
				this application.
				<br>
				<br>
				v0.1 (pre-release) was released on GitHub on May 1st 2024

				<br>Start: 27th November 2021
				<br>Discontinued: 28th November 2021
				<br><br>
				I used C++ to program Conway's Game of Life in the console. I recorded the whole thing but I have yet to edit or <br>
				upload any of it. It took me one 5 hour sitting on the 27th to code this. In those 5 hours, the last 3 or so hours<br>
				were spent realising that i needed to hold an old and new 'frame' (really just a 2d array of characters) and only print<br>
				the new	one once it had finished updating.

				<a href="https://github.com/bensgrant/GrantOS">GrantOS</a><br>
				<br>Start: May 2021
				<br>Discontinued: Jan 2022
				<br><br>
				I used to be interested in low level code, especially stuff to do with Assembly code. This project is a remnant of <br>
				that period. I followed a tutorial for the bootloader and printing single characters to the screen after boot but the<br>
				print(s, s_len) function was my doing. 
				<br>
				There were many versions of this OS, one even had my attempt at VGA drivers (from a tutorial) that didn't work. <br>
				(Un)fortunately it was never released on GitHub. I was only 15 at the time and didn't quite realise how much of a<br>
				monumental task this OS would've been. I'd like to learn how to do this stuff again at some point in the future but<br>
				now I have adopted a more modest approach to programming so I am well aware an Operating System is far beyond my <br>
				current abilities.
				<br>
				I used QEMU on an Ubuntu 20.04 VM running on a Windows 10 host to 'run' the OS.
